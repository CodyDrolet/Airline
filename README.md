# Airline

The goal is to use Airline flight data to try to see what affects airlines' fuel efficiency.
What question(s) do you want to answer?
Airline companies spend a lot of money on fuel and the more fuel-efficient airlines tend to save more money per flight. With flight data and weather data readily available the question raises does the weather have an effect on airlines' fuel efficiency, which airline is more fuel efficient and why? Does precipitation have an effect on fuel efficiency for airplanes?
Why does this topic interest you? Why should someone else be interested?
This topic interests me because I have family and friends in the airline industry and wanted to get something going to get my foot in the door.
